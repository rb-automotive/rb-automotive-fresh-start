  { id: 'doug-1', name: "Doug Purton", rating: 5, comment: "It all started with an overheating Suzuki swift! After about 4 days, and removing half of the engine, and the whole dashboard, to get to the problems, the job was done. As I was working away at the time, it was all communicated by text messages and phone calls. Az made it very clear, and easy for me to understand what was happening with my car. I had no worries about leaving the keys with him, as he seems to be very professional and completely trust", date: "" },
